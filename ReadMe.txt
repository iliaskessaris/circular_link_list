In this project we define the functions AddNode(), DeleteNode() and PrintList()
to manipulate the nodes of a circular linked list in ascending order, through a user interface.
Each node of the circular link list contains two parts: one with the data, an integer in our 
case, and another with a pointer to the next node. At the end of the execution the numbers
on the list are stored in a file named "Circular.txt" and at the beginning read from that file
if it exists.
